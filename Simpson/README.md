# Simpsons's Rule Algorithm
## About Simpson.m 
Simpson.m is an algorithm that takes tabular data input and computes the integral of the data using Simpson's 1/3 Rule and the Trapezoidal Rule based on the amount of intervals in the data set (will apply trapezoidal rule to last interval if there is an odd amount of intervals).
## Inputs
* x - this is the data table for the independent variable of the data
* y - this is the data table for the dependent variable of the data
## Output
* I - this is the integral value based on Simpson's 1/3 Rule
## Other Useful Information
The algorithm is set to automatically detect whether there is an odd or even amount of intervals. The algorithm will also automatically alert the user when the trapezoidal rule was used to calculate the integral of the data.
